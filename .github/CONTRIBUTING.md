## Contributing

Contributions to this project are, of course, entirely welcome! Here are a few
simple guidelines for lending a hand:

### Issues

If you have a feature request or want to report a bug, simply open an issue on
GitHub! For feature requests, describe in appropriate detail what you think
should be added, and why it's important (or just why it would be nice.) For bug
reports, give a thorough explanation of what's happening, and how to reproduce
it. The template that appears when you go to open a new issue will remind you of
exactly what's needed for a quality contribution.

### Pull Requests

If you want to contribute your own code to the project, fork the repo on GitHub,
*create a new branch with a meaningful name* (such as `fix-flux-capacitor-bug`
or `enable-automatic-discombobulation`,) make your changes, and then open a
request to pull from your fork into the master branch. If you need to make more
changes after the PR is opened, just add more commits to the correct branch on
your fork. You don't need to rebase as you go, although you're welcome to; any
subsequent commits you make can be squashed when the PR is merged.

Here are a couple things to keep in mind when working on your pull request:

1. Try to adhere to the style guidelines (two-space indents, etc.) If your IDE
or editor supports EditorConfig, it should figure that out on its own. There is
also a linter config in place to make sure that your code is up-to-standards,
which you can use to check your work, and it will be automatically
double-checked when you commit to the PR branch on your fork. Don't worry about
failing, just make any changes needed and re-commit!
2. If you're adding a substantial amount of code, or new features, it may be
necessary to add tests to cover the new functionality. You don't have to go
overboard, just add enough to make sure that your code is actually doing what
it's supposed to. A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself, "What do I need to
do to make sure a careless person doesn't come by and break my code?" If you've
done that much, it's plenty.
3. Give time for your request to be reviewed, and be open to constructive
feedback from maintainers. Your effort is truly appreciated, and even if your PR
is blocked pending changes, we still want to see it through to merge! Requests
for changes are *never* meant to be personal, it's just meant to show that we
care. :)

Again, thank you for your interest in helping out with this project! We look
forward to your input and contributions!
