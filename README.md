# atom-ts-transpiler

This package serves as a simple shim between [Atom](https://atom.io/) and the
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) transpiler, allowing Atom to run
packages that are written and distributed in TypeScript, using the package's own
TypeScript configuration file. Special thanks go to the folks at GitHub for
making the
[`atom-babel6-transpiler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/atom-babel6-transpiler)
package, which inspired this attempt to bring TypeScript to a larger portion of
the Atom modding community.

## Usage

Using `atom-ts-transpiler` is *extremely* simple. Write your package in
TypeScript, then follow these steps to get it running in Atom:

1. Add `atom-ts-transpiler` and `typescript` to your package.json file as
   dependencies (Note: **not** devDependencies) or do
   `npm install --save typescript atom-ts-transpiler`. You can specify whichever
   version of TypeScript your project needs in order to work properly; anything
   \>1.6 should be fine, but older versions *will not* work.
2. Make sure that your package has a
   [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)
   file, and that it builds properly with `tsc` on the command-line. This is
   technically optional, but it makes it much easier to typecheck your code and
   make sure that it compiles sensibly.
3. Add an `atomTranspilers` entry to your package.json file, like so:

```js
{
  "name": "my-super-duper-package",
  "version": "2.1.4",
  // ...
  "atomTranspilers": [
    {
      "glob": "**/*.ts",
      "transpiler": "atom-ts-transpiler",
      "compilerOptions": {
        // Optional. Anything put here will override the
        // settings specified in your tsconfig.json file.
      },
      "cacheKeyFiles": [
        // Optional. File paths put here will cause the entire
        // compile cache to be invalidated when those files change.
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

And that's it! Now, any time a file matching `glob` is loaded or required at
runtime, Atom will pass it through the TypeScript transpiler, caching the result
until your package is updated or one of the `cacheKeyFiles` changes. It's that
easy!
